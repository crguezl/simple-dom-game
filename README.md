This is a simple JS/DOM game made by [codepo8](https://github.com/codepo8) and me for [Webmuses](http://webmus.es/) JavaScript workshop.

It shows basic JS/DOM concepts and how to use them.

No, it's not in canvas. No, it doesn't have a game loop. Yes, I know it's not perfect and it misses things. Feel free to fork it and add stuff! :)
